# Summary
This is a mini project for movie ticket booking using servlets for course CIS 4660 Applications Development using JAVA. 
Allows user to create and log into account, select from the list of movies available on predefined time and dates, select the desired seats and book the tickets. Go to history and see all previous bookings. 
I used J2EE as middleware, HTML and JSP for user interface, MySQL datbase for backend.
